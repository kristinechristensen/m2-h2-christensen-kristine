Assignment 2: Creating a Web Page

## About This Code ##
I had a lot of fun playing around with the tags and learning new ways to format it. I know that inline styles aren't the best but I couldn't help but use them for the first website. HTML is coming back to me a bit but the CSS is a bit rough. Looking forward to learning more!
